* We are looking for well designed, testable and maintainable code.	
  * I have structured the code in a workflow/task/dataflow manner, I have followed many OO principles here.
  * The code will become more maintainable as its extended in this structure, as you will see i have added the beginnings of a WebApi library.
  * Threading is kept well under control in this structure.

* Use as little memory as possible and make it run as fast as possible.
  * [Premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming.](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~damithch/pages/SE-quotes.htm?type=bestQuotes)
* In your comments, discuss the runtime order complexity of your solution e.g., O(n) or O(n^2), etc.	
* Comment on resiliency.
* Explain any assumptions or trade-offs you have made.
